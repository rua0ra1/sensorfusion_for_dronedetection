### sensorfusion_for_dronedetection
The objective of this repo is to understand the current research in sensor fusion for drone detection. and Implement a simple sensor fusion program using opensource data

## Task List
# create YOLO training data from drone detection video dataset
- [x] Task 1: Extracting frames from the video
- [ ] Task 2: Annotating those frames with bounding boxes (either manually or automatically).
- [ ] Task 3: Saving the annotations in the YOLO format.
- [ ] Task 4: Organizing the dataset for YOLO training.

# train and test the two YOLO models with IR and RGB data respectively
- [ ] Task 5: Train the model with new data
- [ ] Task 6: test the model

# Build DNN model for drone detection audio data
- [x] Task 7: Saving the annotations in the YOLO format.
- [ ] Task 8: Organizing the dataset for YOLO training.

# Fuse the results from 3 ANN models to get the better estimation
