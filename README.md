# sensorfusion_for_dronedetection
The objective of this repo is to understand the current research in sensor fusion for drone detection. and Implement a simple sensor fusion program using opensource data

## Task List
### create YOLO training data from drone detection video dataset
- [x] Task 1: Extracting frames from the video
- [x] Task 2: Annotating those frames with bounding boxes (either manually or automatically).
- [X] Task 3: Saving the annotations in the YOLO format.
- [X] Task 4: Organizing the dataset for YOLO training.

### train and test the two YOLO models with IR and RGB data respectively
- [x] Task 5: Train the model with new data
- [x] Task 6: test the model

### Build DNN model for drone detection audio data
- [x] Task 7: Saving the annotations in the YOLO format.
